# Hands-On Hardware Side Channels Lab

This repository contains all the starting code you will need for the lab. 

## Starting the Lab

As stated on the lab handout, you must first change the `SENDER_CPU` and `RECEIVER_CPU` variables in the `cpu.mk` to your assigned CPUs. **Double check that you have set these values correctly.**

After completing these steps, you are now ready to start the lab. Good luck!

the name keeps it anonymous so that no one can see the google for the code
that I write.
